# surfs_up
## Analysis Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to use the power of advanced data storage and retrieval techniques within SQLAlchemy and a SQLite database to devise a plan to open a surf and ice cream shop in Hawaii. This challenge specifically dives into the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 
## Results
There are three major talking points from the two analysis deliverables which can be seen in the images below.
